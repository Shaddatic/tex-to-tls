# Texture to TLS

A small, non-flashy tool to quickly export texture files (.pak, .prs, .pvm, .gvm, .pvmx, .xvm) in the form of a Ninja Texlist Structure (.tls) file printed to stdout! Made primarily for Enhanced Chao World but fully applicable for any other mod for Sonic Adventure DX and 2, and maybe other projects!

Drag and drop a texture file onto the executable and select an export mode and a .tls file will be printed to the console.

Feel free to fork and make changes, I'd love to see some of the logic being done less crudely, but it works for now!
